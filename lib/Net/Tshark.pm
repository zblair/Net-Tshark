=head1 NAME

Net::Tshark - Interface for the tshark network capture utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Tshark;

  # Start the capture process, looking for packets containing HTTP requests and responses
  my $tshark = Net::Tshark->new;
  $tshark->start(interface => 2, display_filter => 'http');

  # Do some stuff that would trigger HTTP requests/responses for 30 s
  sleep 30;

  # Get any packets captured
  $tshark->stop;
  my @packets = $tshark->get_packets;
  
  # Extract packet information by accessing each packet like a nested hash
  my $src_ip = $packets[0]->{ip}->{src};
  my $dst_ip = $packets[0]->{ip}->{dst};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module that uses the command-line tshark utility to capture packets,
parse the output, and format the results as perl hash-like structures.

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item $tshark = Net::Tshark->new()

Returns a newly created C<Net::Tshark> object.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item $tshark->start(%options)

  Parameters:
  interface      - network interface to use (1, 2, etc)
  capture_filter - capture filter, as used by tshark
  display_filter - display filter, as used by tshark
  duration       - maximum number of seconds to capture packets for

=item $tshark->stop

Terminates the tshark process, stopping any further packet capture. You may still execute C<get_packets> after the tshark process has terminated.

=item $tshark->is_running

Returns a true value if the tshark process is running, or a false value if
the tshark process is not running.

=item $tshark->get_packet

Retrieves the next available captured packet, or returns undef if no packets are
available. Packets are C<Net::Tshark::Packet> objects, which implement much of the same interface as native hashes. Therefore, you can dereference C<Net::Tshark::Packet> objects much as you would nested hashes. In fact, you can even cast a C<Net::Tshark::Packet> object to a real hash:

  # Get a packet and access its fields directly
  my $packet = $tshark->get_packet;
  print "The dst IP is $packet->{ip}->{dst}\n";

  # Deep-copy the packet object and store its fields in a native hash
  my %packet_hash = %{$packet->hash};
  print "The src IP is $packet_hash{ip}->{src}\n";

=item $tshark->get_packets

Retrieves all available captured packets, or returns an empty list if no packets
are available.

  # Get a list of the source ips of all captured IP packets
  my @packets = $tshark->get_packets;
  my @src_ips = map { $_->{ip}->{src} } grep { defined $_->{ip} } @packets;
